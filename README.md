This lab demonstrates how to manipulate table rows using basic HTML and JavaScript.
The original Lab Work is done on file: CSD213 Lab1.html.
The project was mostly completed by me but I wasn't able to properly deleted top row by pressing Delete row button so I got ChatGPT as my refrence.
These are the codes I have taken: let table = document.getElementById ("sampleTable");
    if (table.rows.length > 0) {
      table.deleteRow(0);
    }
Rest of the codes are written by me.
